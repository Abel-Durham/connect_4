The structure of your Connect Four game code is organized into several distinct functions that handle different aspects of the game. Here's a breakdown of the structure and purpose of each function:

1. Initialization and Setup
create_board(): Initializes and returns a 6x7 game board, represented as a list of lists where each cell starts as an empty space (' ').
2. Display Functions
print_board(board): Prints the current state of the board to the console, with vertical and horizontal delimiters for better visualization.
3. Game Logic Functions
drop_disc(board, col, disc): Handles placing a disc in a specified column. It iterates from the bottom of the column upwards to find the first empty slot and places the disc there.

check_win(board, disc): Checks for a win condition for a given disc ('X' or 'O'). It looks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal sequences of four matching discs.

check_stalemate(board): Determines if the board is in a stalemate state, where no more moves are possible because all columns are full.

will_win(board, col, disc): Simulates dropping a disc into a column to check if it results in a win for the given disc. It uses a temporary board to perform this check.

4. Computer AI
computer_move(board): Determines the computer's move. It first tries to find a column where the computer can win immediately. If no such move is available, it checks for columns where the user is about to win and blocks those moves. If neither condition is met, it picks a random available column.
5. Game Loop
play_game(): Manages the main game loop, alternating turns between the user and the computer. It handles user input, updates the board, checks for win conditions, and determines if the game is over.
Summary of Function Calls in play_game():
Initialization: board = create_board()

Game Loop:

Print the board with print_board(board).
Handle user input and move with drop_disc().
Check for win or stalemate with check_win() and check_stalemate().
Switch to computer's turn and perform similar checks and moves.
Code Execution Flow:
Initialization: The game board is created.
Game Loop:
Display the board.
Handle user or computer move based on whose turn it is.
Check for win conditions or stalemate.
Switch turns if the game isn't over.
Game End: Print the final board and announce the winner or tie.
This structure ensures that each part of the game logic is modular and can be easily understood or modified.
